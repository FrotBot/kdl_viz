- A simple visualization lib for KDL::Chains..

This library provides 

a] code for rendering a KDL chain vizualization into an existing OpenGL context
b] a class derived from QGLWidget to drop the visualization into an existing 
   Qt app
c] a class derived from the previous class that offers some rudimentary navigation
   to be able to change the view, etc. 

- Requirements

KDL [a relatively recent version is required [SVN at Nov. 24, 2008]

Qt is only required if you want to build the QKDLChainView or QKDLChainWidget
